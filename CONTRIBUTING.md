# Before submitting a pull request

- Open a GitHub **issue** before submitting a PR
- Clone the repo and **install dependencies** with `yarn`
- Run `npm start` to **compile** the backend, frontend and install the app on Android
  - `npx react-native-cli run-android` to compile and run the app

Hint: SMALL PRs GET REVIEWED QUICKER. :)
